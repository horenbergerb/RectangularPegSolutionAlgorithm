So this file is for noodling with some thoughts I have on the theoretical mechanisms of this proof.

*I assume you've read over everything in the Vaughan folder and have seen the code/paper for this folder.
These spaced blobs are each disconnected thoughts for now

So at the start, we see lambdaXlambda, which is the same funky mobius strip Vaughan started with. But Vaughan condensed the information by embedding it in R^3 using midpoints between pairs of points and distances between pairs of points. In this paper, we don't see any condensing of information, but we do see a similar molding of information.
  Take, for example, the function l(z,w). This takes in the mobius strip, and the first term of the output is actually the midpoints, (z+w/2). What's the other term?

Let's start at the end and work backwards.
  Some output of l(lambdaXlambda) intersects R_phi(lambdaXlambda) at some point, (z, re^(i*(theta+phi))).
    Because this point is on the intersection, it must be that z +- re^(i*(theta+phi)) and z +- re^(i*(theta)) all lie on the curve
  We have to find two pair of points on the loop, (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) or (p2,r2,theta2) such that l(p1,q1)=R_phi(p2,r2,theta2).
  What does this mean?
    We know the first term of l(p1,q1) is actually just the midpoint of p1 and q1. And the first term of R_phi(p2,r2,theta2) is just p2. So the midpoint of p1 and q1 must be p2.
      We're going to add and subtract a rotation of some point on the curve (the second term) in order to get the rectangle points on the curve
    So the second terms... We'll say, for simplicity, the 'anti-midpoint' of p1 and q1 must have the same magnitude as q2 and be rotated by exactly phi.
