This is an implementation of the impressive new solution to the Rectangular Peg Problem.
The implementation itself is not very impressive.
See here for the original paper: #https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09193.pdf
I'm going to try and apply this to more interesting curves next.

NOTE:
This should work for curves in general,
however...
The granularity of curve samples can be problematic if the distance is too wide, then solutions which are in lambdaX{0} won't be detected as such, because the nearest lambda sample will be too far away.
