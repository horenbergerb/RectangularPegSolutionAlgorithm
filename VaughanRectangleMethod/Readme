I'm actually using this source to help parse some of Vaughan's work:

The idea is that Vaughan wanted to show a rectangle could always be constructed from the points on certain loops.

There are a few key realizations to Vaughan's proof, and I thought I'd summarize them here:

  Vaughan realized another way to define a rectangle is by considering the line segments between each pair of diagonal points. These two line segments are equal in length and share a midpoint. This means that looking for a rectangle in the points on a curve is equivalent to looking for two pairs of points whose line segments are the same length and which have the same midpoint.

  Vaughan knew that the set of all pairs of points on a smooth loop plot a surface (in 4D space) which has the same topology as a Mobius strip. Without going into detail, this means that "walking around" on the surface will be just like walking around on a Mobius strip, although paths might be longer or shorter.

  Vaughan condensed the information into strictly the essentials: he mapped each pair of points, (x1, y1) and (x2,y2) into a single 3D point, (x,y,z). (x,y) is the midpoint between (x1, y1) and (x2,y2), and (z) is the length of the line segment between them. Now finding a rectangle is equivalent to finding two pairs of points that map to the same (x,y,z)

  Vaughan realized that this mapping is actually an embedding of the mobius strip of pairs of points into R^3. As a consequence, searching for two pairs of points that map to the same (x,y,z) (equivalent to a rectangle) is the same as looking for a self-intersection of the surface.

  Vaughan realized that this embedded mobius strip was almost an embedding of the projective plane, but not quite. the embedded mobius strip is "sitting"on the xy plane, specifially on top of the original loop. But if you "fill in" the space in the xy plane inside that loop, then the whole creation is now actually equivalent to the projective plane

  Finally, it's known that embeddings of the projective plane in R^3 must self-intersect. We can show the intersection doesn't happen on the part that we "filled in," so it must happen on our embedded mobius strip, which means there's definitely a rectangle on this loop!

  What a wild ride.

#Program Overview#
##################

This program takes a custom loop and embeds its pairs of points into R^3 in the same way that Vaughan describes.

Here's how to use it:

1) Run CurveDrawer.py
2) Hold down the left mouse button and draw a smooth loop
3) Run VaughanEmbedPairs.py
4) Enjoy

Parameters you can play with:
'res' in the CurveDrawer.py details the distance between samples of your loop

  I'd like to approximate the self-intersections of this embedding. It would be interesting because Vaughan used this method to prove that some rectangle must exist, but you can observe that there appears to be many self-intersections. In addition, they might follow a smooth path. I wonder what information you could extract from this.
